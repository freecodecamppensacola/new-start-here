## Tip:
---
### HTML / CSS
The curriculum on FreeCodeCamp is good enough. Supplement with free [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/register) for more practice.

### jQuery / JavaScript
FreeCodeCamp modules are a bit more advanced. Start at [C0d3](https://www.c0d3.com), [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/register), or [Upskill](https://upskillcourses.com/) first for a basic foundation if you get stuck.
