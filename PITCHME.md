@title[Tip]
## A Tip:

#### HTML / CSS
The curriculum on FreeCodeCamp is good enough. Supplement with free [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) exercises for more practice.

#### jQuery / JavaScript
FreeCodeCamp modules for these are more advanced. Start at [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) or [Upskill](https://upskillcourses.com/) _first_ for a basic foundation if you get stuck.
